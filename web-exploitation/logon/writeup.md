## logon

difficulty: medium

---

## sol:

the hint hints towards no password being checked except joes.
this makes me think that the flag is on joes account.

logging in with other users takes you to a page called /flag which says you have logged in, but cant see the flag.

thinking that the point is to get into joes account, i try out sql injection to bypass the password check

not having any success with that i decided to check out the cookies instead. 
one of them is called admin, and set to false. i change it to true and reload the page, which gives me the flag.
