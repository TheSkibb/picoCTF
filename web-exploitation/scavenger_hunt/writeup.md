## Scavenger Hunt

difficulty: medium

### sol:

first part of the flag was in a comment in the html, second in CSS

i thought the third part would be in the js code, byt it did not seem to be.

in the js code, there is a comment asking: "How can I keep Google from indexing my website?", could be a hint that it has something to do with google indexing?
from this [article](https://www.ilfusion.com/how-to-prevent-google-from-indexing-certain-web-pages) i fount that one of the ways to stop google indexing is to specify it in a "robots.txt" file.
by checking the robots.txt file in the next bit of the flag is foun this can also be a place with useful information

in the robots.txt file, there is a hint to the next part of the flag:

> I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?

this part was a bit trickier, i assumed it is some sort of extra file that i should find that has something to do with apache.
(since the hint said not to brute force for the files i chose not to)

from searching around about special apache files and how to list files for a website i stumbled upon this [thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4010158/is-it-possible-to-get-a-list-of-files-under-a-directory-of-a-website-how) 
the thread mentions the [.htacces](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html) file, which is a file used to configure permissions and such.
by going to the .htaccess file, we get the next part of the flag and another clue

> I love making websites on my Mac, I can Store a lot of information there.

since Mac and Store are capitalized which may indicate something...

trying different combinations of /mac/store does not yield any results

searching for mac and store only gives results with apple and MAC stores

after searching a while for potential mac-exclusive files like httpd.conf, httpd-userdir.conf, which could give me any info, and not having any results, i changed approach


maybe mac was a hint to mac-address?
after some research about mac-addresses it seems they are not used outside of local networks, and it seems this was a dead end

back to macs and storing information

i found some promising pages 
[mapping urls to filesystem locations](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/urlmapping.html)
[apache storage](https://metacpan.org/pod/Apache::Storage)

last part of flag not found yet, continuing work on this later:

### learned

in the devtools, the debugger shows you the javascript code used on the website, and style editor for css shows all css files loaded.

google indexing can be stopped by adding it in a robots.txt file this can also be a place with useful information

if a site is running on apache server, the .htaccess file is where per directory configuration takes place
