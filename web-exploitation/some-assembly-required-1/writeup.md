## Some Assembly Required 1

difficulty: easy

---

## sol:

this problem seems to may be a SQL injection.
after testing sending some requests i noticed that there was no network traffic, so i decided to checkout the debugger to see what javascript was running on the server

in the javascript there was nothing special, but there was some other code in the wasm dir.
inspecting the code in this file i found the flag

## learned

you can also find wasm code in the debugger
