## Insp3ct0r

difficulty: v easy

---

### sol:

from the task description it is obvious that the point is to inspect the website code.

opening the inspector and searching for "pico" reveals 1/3 of the flag in a comment in the html code

the "how" part of the website says that it is made from three parts: html, css and js, which could be a hint to where the other parts of the flags are.

in the inspector, by searching for "script", i fount it to be loaded from an external site page.
By entering the url for the script, another part of the flag is revealed.

doing the same for the CSS gives us the last missing part of the flag

### learned:

since scripts and css files can be called from external pages, it is smart to check out these files.
