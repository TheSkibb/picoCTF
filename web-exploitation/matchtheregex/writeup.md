## MatchTheRegex

difficulty:

## sol

in the js code i found a regex in the comments ^p.....F!?
using a online [regex explorer](https://regexr.com/) i could create a string which matched:

^ means that the regex checks the start of the string
p means p
. means any character
F means F
! means !
? means a quantifier, it must match between 0 and 1 of the preceding token

i found the flag with picoCTF!?
