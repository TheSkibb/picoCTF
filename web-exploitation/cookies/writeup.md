## cookies

difficulty: medium

## sol:

i found a cookie called name, with value -1 when changing this value to one and reloading the /check page i got the massage that it is a valid cookie, but not a special one

i therefore made a python script which would send requests with different values 1-30 for the cookie

running the script and grep-ing for pico i found the flag

~~~py
py loadcookies.py | grep pico
~~~
