## Sol:

there is no js on the site checking the password.
submitting the form is sent as post request to /login.php
special characters are not allowed and result in "Illegal character in username or password."

going to login.php we find some interesting js code in the file secure.js with a admin username and password

logging in with the found credentials gives us the flag
