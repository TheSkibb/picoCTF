## search source

difficulty: medium

## sol:

the task says that the flag is somewhere in the source and hints to it being a good idea to clone it to your computer to use more powerful tools:

i do a wget request with the flag -r to also get other files referenced in the html document

i then grep for pico in the dowloaded files and found the flag
